## Developing a plan

1.  App concept: A form to input an ingredient and get back recipes for dishes that contain that ingredient.

2.  What do we want the app to do?

- take request for the dish
- read the request
- pull the necessary data from an api
- display such data

3.  What components will we need?

- Display/Main
- Search

4.  What functions will we need?

- display recipe name
- fetch recipe
- Link to go Home
